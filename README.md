# Tutorial of an Exploratory Analysis of the Impact of Religion on The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)

In this project, we provide an end-to-end walk-through of identifying and scraping data from the GGGI and each country's major religion for the years 2010-2021, performing an exploratory analysis, and investigating how a country's major religion(s) impact the size of its gender gap in terms of health, education, economics, and politics. 
     
**Three main questions that this project aims to answer are:**
1. How does religion impact a country's gender gap subindex scores in terms of health, education, economics, and politics?

2. Are particular major religions related to a lower overall gender gap index score?

3. Can we predict how a country's gender gap index score will change over time based on the prediction of its future major religion?
