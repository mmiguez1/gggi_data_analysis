# Tutorial of an Exploratory Analysis of the Impact of Religion on The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)

In this project, we provide an end-to-end walk-through of identifying and scraping data from the GGGI and each country's major religion for the years 2010-2021, performing an exploratory analysis, and investigating how a country's major religion(s) impact the size of its gender gap in terms of health, education, economics, and politics. 
      
           
The Global Gender Gap Index is a score ranging from 0 to 1 with 0 being the lowest score and 1 being the highest score (indicating the gender gap is closed). Each country's index score is measured on four subindexes: Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment. The World Economic Forum compiles the subindex scores of each country to create the Global Gender Gap Index. More information can be found at the [World Economic Forum's website.](https://www.weforum.org/)      
     
**Three main questions that this project aims to answer are:**
1. How does religion impact a country's gender gap subindex scores in terms of health, education, economics, and politics?

2. Are particular major religions related to a lower overall gender gap index score?

3. Can we predict how a country's gender gap index score will change over time based on the prediction of its future major religion?
